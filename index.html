  With this project, we at the ‘Prince’, the second-oldest college newspaper in the country, took a step back. Leveraging data from the The Daily Princetonian Larry Dupraz Archives, kindly shared with us by Mudd Library, we immersed ourselves in decades worth of print publications in the hope of better understanding the journey the ‘Prince’ and the University have been on over the past 140 years." />

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      In May 2020, two months after students were sent home due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
      dozens enrolled in MAT 202: Linear Algebra with Applications were referred to the
      Committee on Discipline after a teaching assistant (TA) posted a false solution on
      the online resource Slader — which was subsequently covered extensively in
      <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/05/princeton-teaching-assistant-math-department-slader-mat202-academic-integrity-cheating-covid">The Daily Princetonian</a>.
      The details first spread to the student body, however, via TigerConfessions, an anonymous Facebook page.

<p>
  From complaints about classes to exchanges about eating clubs, the TigerConfessions Facebook page has allowed Princeton students to anonymously share their thoughts since <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2019/01/tigerconfessions">2018</a>. Anonymous confession pages are not unique to Princeton — there’s also, for example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cunyconfessions/">CUNY Confessions</a> on Facebook and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yale.confessions/?hl=en">Yale Confessions</a> on Instagram.
  </p>
  <p>
  Only currently enrolled Princeton students are allowed to join the group and submit confessions through a Google Form. From there, the group moderator, an anonymous Princeton student who uses the pseudonym Tyga San, individually approves and posts submissions to the private Facebook group. Once posted, anyone in the group can publicly react to or comment on the confession.
  </p>
  <p>
  All posts are accepted except “low-effort, boring, or incomprehensible content,” as well as “low-effort or inflammatory political content” without a name signed to it, personal attacks, suicidal thoughts, duplicate posts, and advertisements.
  </p>
  <p>
  At its peak, TigerConfessions was the locus of campus conversation. In May 2020, 6 percent of all posts on TigerConfessions contained “MAT202” or “MAT 202,” and nearly 8 percent of all posts on Tiger Confessions contained “202.” (Some students referred to the class as “202” by itself, although a few posts containing “202” were used to refer to other courses).
  </p>
  <p>
  Yet usage of the COVID-era tool has declined substantially.
  </p>
  <p>
  Submissions hit an all-time high during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring of 2020, with an average of about 113 posts a day. Since then, posting has noticeably declined, decreasing to an average of about 6 posts a day in Fall 2022 — a period when other anonymous confession apps, such as <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2022/09/fizz-sidechat-compete-students-attention-anonymous">Fizz</a>, have increased in popularity.
  </p>
  <p>
  Facebook usage among Princeton students has also declined overall — the Official Princeton Class of 2023 page has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/OfficialPrinceton2023/">2100</a> members, while the Class of 2026 page has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/327176575629409/">1200</a> members. According to the Daily Princetonian’s inaugural <a href="https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/frosh-survey-24/lifestyle.html">Frosh Survey</a>, 43 percent of the incoming Class of 2024 used Facebook on a regular basis, compared to only <a href="https://projects.dailyprincetonian.com/froshsurvey-26/lifestyle.html#RecreationNav">17.3 percent</a> of the incoming Class of 2026. At the same time, TigerConfessions has fallen into disuse.
  </p>
  <p>
  Using a post submission dataset provided by the moderator, we looked at how the Facebook group has reflected campus conversations over the past three years. The dataset contains the text of confessions that were submitted and approved from October 2019 to mid-January 2023.

      <strong>Methodology</strong>
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Sources</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The data used in our analysis for all years proceeding 2015 was sourced directly from Mudd Library, which shared
      with the ‘Prince’ a database containing optical character recognition (OCR) data from the Larry Dupraz archive. We
      did not independently verify this database against the raw image data in the archive or Princeton University
      Library’s archive explorer. For years succeeding 2015, the ‘Prince’ used data from internal web archives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We first removed all tokens of the form ’xx to prevent class year attributions from dominating frequency analysis.
      We removed all capitalization and punctuation in order to ensure that errors in OCR, which can frequently
      miscaptialize letters or insert unnecessary punctuation, would not prevent terms from being recognized. This means
      that all emblematic terms are not case sensitive, e.g. tokens like “princeton,” “Princeton,” “pRinceton” are all
      recognized as the same term.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Term Extraction</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ‘Prince’ used a whitespace tokenizer to count word frequencies for each decade. Then, for each analyzed
      decade, we compared the frequency of all terms in that decade against a corpus containing data for that decade and
      the preceding and following decades. For the 2010s and 1880s, we used the single neighboring decade. Like <a
        href="https://pudding.cool/2018/12/brief-history/">The Pudding</a>, we only included words that were used at
      least once in 10,000 words in each decade to ensure the relevancy of analyzed terms. Using each decade’s list of
      disproportionately used words, we then searched the archives to find historically and culturally relevant uses of
      those words to share in the summaries.
